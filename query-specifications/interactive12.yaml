  Given a start Person, find the Comments that this Person's
  friends made in reply to Posts, considering only those Comments
  that are immediate (1-hop) replies to Posts, not the transitive
  (multi-hop) case.  Only consider Posts with a Tag in a given
  TagClass or in a descendent of that TagClass.  Count the number
  of these reply Comments, and collect the Tags (with valid tag
  class) that were attached to the Posts they replied to.  Return
  Persons with at least one reply, the reply count, and
  the collection of Tags.
