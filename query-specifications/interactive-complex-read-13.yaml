title: Single shortest path
description: |
  Given two Persons, find the shortest path between these two Persons in the subgraph induced by the Knows relationships.

  Return the length of this path:

  * $-1$ : no path found
  * $0$: start person = end person
  * $> 0$: regular case
parameters:
  - name: person1.id
    type: ID
  - name: person2.id
    type: ID
result:
  - name: length
    type: 32-bit Integer
    category: calculated

  This query looks for a variable length path, starting at a given Person and finishing at an another given Person.
  Proper cardinality estimation and search space prunning, will be crucial. This query also allows for possible parallel
  implementations.
