  Given a *Person*, find all other *Persons* that live in a given *Country* and are connected to given *Person* by a transitive trail with length in range `[minPathDistance, maxPathDistance]` through the *knows* relation.

  In the trail, an edge can be only traversed once while nodes can be traversed multiple times (as opposed to a path which allows repetitions of both nodes and edges).

  For each of these *Persons*, retrieve all of their *Messages* that contain at least one *Tag* belonging to a given *TagClass* (direct relation not transitive). For each *Message*, retrieve all of its *Tags*.

  Group the results by *Persons* and *Tags*, then count the *Messages* by a certain *Person* having a certain *Tag*.

  (Note: it is not yet decided whether a *Person* connected to the start *Person* on a trail with a length smaller than `minPathDistance`, but also on a trail with the length in `[minPathDistance, maxPathDistance]` should be included. The current reference implementations allow such *Persons*, but this might be subject to change in the future.)
