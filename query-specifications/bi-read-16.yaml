  Given a *Person*, find all other *Persons* that live in a given `country` and are connected to given *Person* by a transitive path with length in range `[minPathDistance, maxPathDistance]` through the *knows* relation.

  In the path, an edge can be only traversed once while nodes can be traversed multiple times.

  For each of these *Persons*, retrieve all of their *Messages* that contain at least one *Tag* belonging to a given *TagClass* (direct relation not transitive). For each *Message*, retrieve all of its *Tags*.

  Group the results by *Persons* and *Tags*, then count the *Messages* by a certain *Person* having a certain *Tag*.
