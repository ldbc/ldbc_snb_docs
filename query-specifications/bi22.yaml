  Consider all pairs of people `(p1, p2)` such that one is located in a city of Country `countryX`
  and the other is located in a city of Country `countryY`.

  For each city of Country `countryX`, return the highest scoring pair.

  The score of a pair is defined as the sum of the scores of the following kinds of interaction\:

  * `p1` has created a reply Comment to at least one Comment or Post by `p2`\: `Score = 4`
  * `p1` has created at least one Post or Comment that `p2` has created a reply Comment to\: `Score = 1`
  * `p1` and `p2` Know each other\: `Score = 15`
  * `p1` liked at least one Post or Comment by `p2`\: `Score = 10`
  * `p1` has created at least one Post or Comment that was liked by `p2`\: `Score = 1`

  I.e., the maximum score a pair can obtain is\: `4 + 1 + 15 + 10 + 1 = 31`
