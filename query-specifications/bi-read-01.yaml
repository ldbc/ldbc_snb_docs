  Given a date, find all *Messages* created before that date.
  Group them by a 3-level grouping\:

  1. by year of creation
  2. for each year, group into *Message* types: is *Comment* or not
  3. for each year-type group, split into four groups based on length of their content
      * `0`: 0 <= length < 40\ (short)
      * `1`: 40 <= length < 80\ (one liner)
      * `2`: 80 <= length < 160\ (tweet)
      * `3`: 160 <= length\ (long)
