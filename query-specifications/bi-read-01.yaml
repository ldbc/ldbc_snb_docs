  Given a date, find all Messages created before that date.
  Group them by a 3-level grouping\:

  1. by year of creation
  2. for each year, group into message types, i.e., Posts or Comments
  3. for each year-type group, split into four groups based on length of their content
      * 0 <= length < 40\: `short`
      * 40 <= length < 80\: `one liner`
      * 80 <= length < 160\: `tweet`
      * 160 <= length\: `long`
