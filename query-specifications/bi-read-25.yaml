title: Weighted paths
description: |
  Given two Persons, find all (unweighted) shortest paths between these two Persons, in the subgraph induced by the
  Knows relationship.

  Then, for each path calculate a weight. The nodes in the path are Persons, and the weight of a path is the sum of
  weights between every pair of consecutive Person nodes in the path.

  The weight for a pair of Persons is calculated such that every reply (by one of the Persons) to a Post (by the other
  Person) contributes 1.0, and every reply (by ones of the Persons) to a Comment (by the other Person) contributes 0.5.

  Only consider messages that were created in a forum that was created within the timeframe `[startDate, endDate]`.

  Return all the paths with shortest length, and their weights.
