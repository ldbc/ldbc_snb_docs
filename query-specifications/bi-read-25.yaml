title: Trusted connection paths
description: |
  Given two *Persons*, find all (unweighted) shortest paths between these two *Persons*, in the subgraph induced by the *knows* relationship.

  Then, for each path calculate a weight. The nodes in the path are *Persons*, and the weight of a path is the sum of weights between every pair of consecutive *Person* nodes in the path.

  The weight for a pair of *Persons* is calculated based on their interactions:

  * Every direct reply (by one of the *Persons*) to a *Post* (by the other *Person*) contributes 1.0.
  * Every direct reply (by one of the *Persons*) to a *Comment* (by the other *Person*) contributes 0.5.

  Only consider *Messages* that were created in a *Forum* that was created within the timeframe `[startDate, endDate]`. Note that for *Comments*, the containing *Forum* is that of the *Post* that the comment (transitively) replies to.

  Return all paths with the *Person* ids ordered by their weights descending.
