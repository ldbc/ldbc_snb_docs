  Get each *Person* (`person`) who has created a *Message* (`message`) with a given *Tag* (direct relation, not transitive). Considering only these messages, for each *Person*\ node:

  * Count its `message`s (`messageCount`).
  * Count *likes* (`likeCount`) to its `message`s.
  * Count *Comments* (`replyCount`) in reply to it `message`s.

  The `score` is calculated according to the following formula: `1 * messageCount + 2 * replyCount + 10 * likeCount`.
