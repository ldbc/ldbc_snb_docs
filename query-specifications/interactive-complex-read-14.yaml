description: |
  Given two *Persons*, find all (unweighted) shortest paths between these two *Persons*, in the subgraph induced by the *knows* relationship.
  
  Then, for each path calculate a weight. The nodes in the path are *Persons*, and the weight of a path is the sum of weights between every pair of consecutive *Person* nodes in the path.

  The weight for a pair of *Persons* is calculated based on their interactions:

  * Every direct reply (by one of the *Persons*) to a *Post* (by the other *Person*) contributes 1.0.
  * Every direct reply (by one of the *Persons*) to a *Comment* (by the other *Person*) contributes 0.5.

  Return all the paths with shortest length, and their weights. Do not return any rows if there is no path between the two *Persons*.

relevance: |
  This query looks for a variable length path, starting at a given *Person* and finishing at an another given *Person*. This is a more complex query as it not only requires computing the path length, but returning it and computing a weight. To compute this weight one must look for smaller sub-queries with paths of length three, formed by the two *Persons* at each step, a *Post* and a *Comment*.
