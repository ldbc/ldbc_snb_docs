title: Zombies in a country
description: |
  Find zombies within the given `country`, and return their zombie scores.

  A `zombie` is a *Person* created before the given `endDate`, which has created an average of `[0, 1)` *Messages* per month, during the time range between profile creation date and the given `endDate`. The number of months spans the time range from creation date of the profile to the `endDate` and also includes partial months.

  For each `zombie`, calculate the following\:

  * `zombieLikeCount`: the number of likes received from other zombies
  * `totalLikeCount`: the total number of likes received on that *Person*'s *Messages*
  * `zombieScore`: `zombieLikeCount` / `totalLikeCount`

  For both `zombieLikeCount` and `totalLikeCount`, only count likes received from profiles that were created before the given `endDate`.
