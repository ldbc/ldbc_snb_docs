title: Stranger's interaction
description: |
  For all the Persons born after a certain date, find all the strangers they interacted with, where strangers are
  Persons that do not Know each other. There is no restriction on the date that strangers were born.

  Consider only strangers that are members of Forums tagged with tagClass1 (direct children not transitive) AND
  members of Forums tagged with tagClass2 (direct children not transitive).
  It does not matter if these Tags are attached to the same Forum, or different Forums.

  Interaction is defined as follows\: if Person _A_ replies to a Message (Post or Comment) by another Person _B_,
  there is an "interacted with" relationship from _A_ to _B_. Note that the "interacted with" relationship is directed.

  For each Person, count the number of strangers they interacted with and total number of times they interacted with them.
