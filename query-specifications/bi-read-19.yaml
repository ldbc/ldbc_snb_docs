title: Stranger's interaction
description: |
  For all the *Persons* (`person`) born after a certain `date`, find all the `stranger`s they interacted with, where `stranger`s are *Persons* that do not *know* `person`. There is no restriction on the date that `stranger`s were born.

  Consider only `stranger`s that are

  * members of *Forums* tagged with a *Tag* with a (direct) type of `tagClass1` and
  * members of *Forums* tagged with a *Tag* with a (direct) type of `tagClass2`.

  The *Tags* may be attached to the same *Forum* or they may be attached to different *Forums*.

  Interaction is defined as follows\: the `person` has replied to a *Message* by the `stranger` _B_ (the reply might be a transitive one).

  For each `person`, count the number of `strangers` they interacted with (`strangerCount`) and total number of times they interacted with them (`interactionCount`).
