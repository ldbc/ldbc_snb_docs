  This query looks for paths of length two, starting from a given Person, going through its created Messages and
  finishing at their replies. In this query there is temporal locality between the replies being accessed. Thus the top k
  order by this can interact with the selection, i.e. do not consider older posts than the 20th oldest seen so far.
