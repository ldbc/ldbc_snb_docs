  Consider all pairs of people `(person1, person2)` such that one is located in a *City* of *Country* `country1` and the other is located in a *City* of *Country* `country2`. For each *City* of *Country* `country1`, return the highest scoring pair. The score of a pair is defined as the sum of the subscores awarded for the following kinds of interaction. The initial value is `score = 0`.

  1. `person1` has created a reply *Comment* to at least one *Message* by `person2`\: `score += 4`
  2. `person1` has created at least one *Message* that `person2` has created a reply *Comment* to\: `score += 1`
  3. `person1` and `person2` *know* each other\: `score += 15`
  4. `person1` liked at least one *Message* by `person2`\: `score += 10`
  5. `person1` has created at least one *Message* that was liked by `person2`\: `score += 1`

  Consequently, the maximum score a pair can obtain is\: `4 + 1 + 15 + 10 + 1 = 31`.
