  TagClass or in a descendent of that TagClass.  Count the number
  of these reply Comments, and collect the Tags that were attached to the Posts they replied to,

  This query looks for paths of length three, starting at a Person, moving to its friends, the to their Comments and
  ending at the Post the Comments are replying. The chain from original post to the reply is transitive. The traversal
  may be initiated at either end, the system may note that this is a tree, hence leaf to root is always best. Additionally,
  a hash table can be built from either end, e.g. from the friends of self, from the tags in the category, from the or
  other.
