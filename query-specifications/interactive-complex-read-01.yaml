  This query is a representative of a simple navigational query. It looks for paths of length one, two or three through
  the knows relation, starting from a given Person and ending at a Person with a given name. It is interesting for several
  aspects. First, it requires for a complex aggregation, that is, returning the concatenation of universities, companies,
  languages and email information of the person. Second, it tests the ability of the optimizer to move the evaluation of
  sub-queries functionally dependant on the Person, after the evaluation of the top-k. Finally, performance is
  highly sensitive to properly estimating the cardinalities in each transitive path, and paying attention not to explode
  already visited Persons.
