  Given a start *Person* with ID `$personId`, find *Persons* with a given first name (`$firstName`) that the start *Person* is connected to (excluding start *Person*) by at most 3 steps via the *knows* relationships. Return *Persons*, including the distance (1..3), summaries of the *Persons* workplaces and places of study.

relevance: |
  This query is a representative of a simple navigational query. It is interesting for several aspects.
  (1) It requires for a complex aggregation for returning the concatenation of universities, companies, languages and email information of the *Person*.
  (2) It tests the ability of the optimizer to move the evaluation of sub-queries functionally dependant on the *Person*, after the evaluation of the top-k.
  (3) Its performance is highly sensitive to properly estimating the cardinalities in each transitive path, and paying attention not to explore already visited *Persons*.
