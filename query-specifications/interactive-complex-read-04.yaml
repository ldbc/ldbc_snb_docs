  This query looks for paths of length two, starting from a given Person, moving to Posts and then to Tags. It tests
  the ability of the query optimizer to properly select the usage of hash joins or index based joins, depending on the
  cardinality of the intermediate results. These cardinalities are clearly affected by the input Person, the number of
  friends, the variety of Tags, the time interval and the number of Posts.
