title: Recent likers
description: |
  Given a start Person, find (most recent) Likes on any of start
  Person's Messages.  Find Persons that Liked any of start
  Person's Messages, the Messages they liked most recently,
  creation date of that Like, and the latency (in minutes) between
  creation of Messages and Like.  Additionally, for each Person
  found return a flag indicating whether the liker is a friend of
  start Person.  In the case that a Person Liked multiple Messages
  at the same time, return the Message with lowest identifier.

  This query looks for paths of length two, starting from a given Person, moving
  to its published messages and then to Persons who liked them. It tests several aspects related to join optimization,
  both at query optimization plan level and execution engine level. On the one hand, many of the columns needed for
  the projection are only needed in the last stages of the query, so the optimizer is expected to delay the projection
  until the end. This query implies accessing 2-hop data, and as a consequence, index accesses are expected to be
  scattered. We expect to observe variate cardinalities, depending on the characteristics of the input parameter, so
  properly selecting the join operators will be crucial. This query has a lot of correlated sub-queries, so it is testing
  the ability to flatten the query execution plans.
