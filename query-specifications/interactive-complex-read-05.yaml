  This query looks for paths of length two and three, starting from a given Person, moving to friends and friends of
  friends, and then getting the Forums they are members of. Besides testing the ability of the query optimizer to select
  the proper join operator, it rewards the usage of indexes, but their accesses will be presumably scattered due to the
  two/three-hop search space of the query, leading to unpredictable and scattered index accesses. Having efficient
  implementations of such indexes will be highly beneficial.
