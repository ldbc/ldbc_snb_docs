	desc. & Given a start Person, find that Person's friends of friends (excluding
start Person, and immediate friends), who were born on or after the 21st
of a given month (in any year) and before the 22nd of the following
month. Calculate the similarity between each of these Persons and start
Person, where similarity for any Person is defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  common = number of Posts created by that Person, such that the Post
  has a Tag that start Person is Interested in
\item
  uncommon = number of Posts created by that Person, such that the Post
  has no Tag that start Person is Interested in
\item
  similarity = common - uncommon

      \small This query looks for paths of length two, starting from a Person and ending at the friends of their friends. It does
widely scattered graph traversal, and one expects no locality of in friends of friends, as these have been acquired
over a long time and have widely scattered identifiers. The join order is simple but one must see that the anti-join
for "not in my friends" is better with hash. Also the last pattern in the scalar sub-queries joining or anti-joining the
tags of the candidate’s posts to interests of self should be by hash.
