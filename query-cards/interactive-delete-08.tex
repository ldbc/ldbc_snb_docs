\begin{itemize}
  \item Removal of a person can (1) remove all associated posts/comments/forum nodes or (2) just the person node. GDPR is a valid argument for (1). Approach (2) could lead to problems with read queries, driver gathering parameters for short reads and inadvertently impose implementation decisions for implementors. 
\item Removal of a person removes forums of type ``personal walls'' and ``image albums'' not ``groups'', which can continue if even the founder has left the network. The hasModerator edge must transition to an existing person node in the network, two approaches to assigning a new moderator were discussed: (1) choose member at random from the set of existing group members or (2) the member with the oldest group join date becomes the moderator.   
\item Removal of a person removes all posts/comments they are creator of this could result in the removal of a comment in the middle of a thread.
