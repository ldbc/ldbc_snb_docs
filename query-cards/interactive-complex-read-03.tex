	relevance &
		\small This query looks for paths of length two and three, starting from a Person, going to friends or friends of friends, and
then moving to Messages. This query tests the ability of the query optimizer to select the most efficient join ordering,
which will depend on the cardinalities of the intermediate results. Many friends of friends can be duplicate, then it is
expected to eliminate duplicates and those people prior to access the Post and Comments, as well as eliminate those
friends from countries X and Y, as the size of the intermediate results can be severely affected. A possible structural
optimization could be to materialize the number of Posts and Comments created by a person, and progressively
filter those people that could not even fall in the top 20 even having all their posts in the countries X and Y.
