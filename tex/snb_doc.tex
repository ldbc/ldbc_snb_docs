\abstract{
LDBC's Social Network Benchmark (LDBC-SNB) is an effort intended to test
various functionalities of systems used for graph-like data management. For this,
LDBC-SNB uses the recognizable scenario of operating a social network, characterized by
its graph-shaped data.

LDBC-SNB consists of three sub-benchmarks, or workloads, that focus on different
functionalities. In this document, we present a preliminary version of the Interactive
Workload. The other workloads, still in development, are the Business
Intelligence Workloads (with analytical queries), and the Graph Analytics
Workload (with graph algorithms).

This document contains a detailed explanation of the data used in the
whole LDBC-SNB benchmark, a detailed description for all the Interactive Workload,
and instructions on how to generate the data and run the benchmark
with the provided software.

\execSummary{

The new data economy era, based on complexly structured, distributed and large
datasets, has brought on new demands on data management and analytics.  As a
consequence, new industry actors have appeared, offering technologies specially
built for the management of graph-like data. Also, traditional database
technologies, such as relational databases, are being adapted to the new
demands to remain competitive. 

LDBC's Social Network Benchmark (LDBC-SNB) is an industrial and academic
initiative, formed by principal actors in the field of graph-like data
management. Its goal is to define a framework where different graph based
technologies can be fairly tested and compared, that can drive the
identification of systems' bottlenecks and required functionalities, and can
help researchers to open new research frontiers. 

The philosophy around which LDBC-SNB is designed is to be easy to
understand, flexible and cheap to adopt. For all these reasons,
LDBC-SNB will propose different workloads representing all the usage scenarios
of graph-like database technologies, hence, targeting systems of different
nature and characteristics.  In order increase its adoption by industry and
research institutions, LDBC-SNB provides all necessary software, which are 
designed to be easy to use and deploy at a small cost.

This document contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item A detailed specification of the data used in the whole LDBC-SNB benchmark.
\item A detailed specification of the workloads.
\item A detailed specification of the execution rules of the benchmark.
\item A detailed specification of the auditing rules and the full disclosure
  report's required contents. 
\end{itemize}
