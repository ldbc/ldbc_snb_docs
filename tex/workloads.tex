\section{Query Description Format}
\label{sub:queries_structure}
Queries are described in natural language using a well-defined structure that consists of three sections:
\textit{description}, a concise textual description of the query;
\textit{parameters}, a list of input parameters and their types;
and \textit{results}, a list of expected results and their types.
The syntax used in \textit{parameters} and \textit{results} sections is as follows:

{\small
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Entity}: entity type in the dataset.\\
            One word, possibly constructed by appending multiple words together, starting with uppercase character and following the camel case notation,
            \eg \texttt{TagClass} represents an entity of type ``TagClass''.
        \item \textbf{Relationship}: relationship type in the dataset.\\
            One word, possibly constructed by appending multiple words together, starting with lowercase character and following the camel case notation,
            and surrounded by arrow to communicate direction,
            \eg \texttt{-worksAt->} represents a directed relationship of type ``worksAt''.
        \item \textbf{Attribute}: attribute of an entity or relationship in the dataset.\\
            One word, possibly constructed by appending multiple words together, starting with lowercase character and following the camel case notation,
            and prefixed by a ``.'' to dereference the entity/relationship,
            \eg \texttt{Person.firstName} refers to ``firstName'' attribute on the ``Person'' entity,
            and \texttt{-studyAt->.classYear} refers to ``classYear'' attribute on the ``studyAt'' relationship.
        \item \textbf{Unordered Set}: an unordered collection of distinct elements.\\
            Surrounded by \{ and \} braces, with the element type between them,
            \eg \texttt{\{String\}} refers to a set of strings.
        \item \textbf{Ordered List}: an ordered collection where duplicate elements are allowed.\\
            Surrounded by [ and ] braces, with the element type between them,
            \eg \texttt{[String]} refers to a list of strings.
        \item \textbf{Ordered Tuple}: a fixed length, fixed order list of elements, where elements at each position of the tuple have predefined, possibly different, types. \\
            Surrounded by < and > braces, with the element types between them in a specific order
            \eg \texttt{<String, Boolean>} refers to a 2-tuple containing a string value in the first element and a boolean value in the second,
            and \texttt{[<String, Boolean>]} is an ordered list of those 2-tuples.
