\paragraph*{Graph processing benchmarks.}

Recent graph benchmarking initiatives focus on three key areas:

\begin{enumerate}
\item transactional workloads consisting of interactive read and update queries (OLTP) aiming at graph databases that explore small portions of the graph in each query~\cite{DBLP:conf/cidr/BarahmandG13,DBLP:conf/sigmod/ArmstrongPBC13,DBLP:journals/ase/DayarathnaS14,DBLP:conf/sigmod/ErlingALCGPPB15,DBLP:journals/pvldb/LissandriniBV18},
\item graph analysis algorithms (\eg PageRank) computed in bulk, typically expressed in cluster frameworks with graph APIs, rather than high-level queries~\cite{DBLP:conf/hipc/BaderM05,DBLP:conf/bigdataconf/ElserM13,DBLP:conf/sc/NaiXTKL15,DBLP:journals/pvldb/IosupHNHPMCCSAT16},
\item pattern matching and inferencing on semantic data~\cite{DBLP:journals/ws/GuoPH05,DBLP:books/sp/virgilio09/SchmidtHMPL09,DBLP:conf/semweb/MorseyLAN11,DBLP:conf/semweb/AlucHOD14,DBLP:journals/sosym/SzarnyasIRV18}.
\end{enumerate}

A recent technical report~\cite{lissandrini17} compares graph databases.

The challenges of using benchmarks correctly are described in~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/RaasveldtHGM18}.

The Interactive queries were used in paper~\cite{DBLP:conf/grades/PacaciZLO17} to compare the performance of Gremlin, Cypher, SQL and SPARQL query engines.
