The schema in the `schema.graphml` file is drawn in [yEd](http://yed.yworks.com/). To export is, go to **File** | **Export...** and **Save**. On the **Clipping** tab, set the **Margin width** to `0` and on the **PDF** tab, set the **Text Rendering Policy** to **Plain Text with embedded Fonts**.

The colours were chosen using [ColorBrewer2's Set3 palette](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Set3&n=12).
