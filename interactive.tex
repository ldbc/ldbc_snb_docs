\chapter{Interactive Workload}
\label{section:interactive}

This workload consists of a set of relatively complex read-only queries, that touch a significant
amount of data -- often the two-step friendship neighborhood and associated messages --, but typically in close proximity to a single node. Hence, the query complexity is sublinear to the dataset size.

The LDBC SNB Interactive workload consists of four query classes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Complex read-only queries.} See \autoref{sec:complex-reads}.
\item \textbf{Short read-only queries.} See \autoref{sec:short-reads}.
\item \textbf{Transactional update queries inserting new entities.} See \autoref{sec:inserts}.
%\item \textbf{Transactional delete queries.} See \autoref{sec:deletes}.
\end{itemize}

A detailed description of the workload (covering reads and inserts) is available in the paper published at \mbox{SIGMOD} 2015~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/ErlingALCGPPB15}.

\section{Updates}
\label{sec:inserts}

Each update query inserts either (1)~a single node of a certain type, along with its edges to other existing nodes or (2)~a single edge of a certain type between two existing nodes.

\section{Deletes}
\label{sec:deletes}

Each delete query removes either (1)~a single edge between two existing nodes or (2)~a node, all incident edges and transitive nodes (where appropriate).
