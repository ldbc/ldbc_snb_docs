\tightlist
\item

  month the \emph{Message} was created,
\item
  gender of \emph{Person},
\item
  age group of \emph{Person}, defined as years between person's birthday
  and end of simulation (2013-01-01), divided by 5, rounded down
  (partial years do not count),
\item
  name of tag attached to \emph{Message}.
\end{enumerate}
Consider only those groups where number of \emph{Messages} is greater
than 100.
