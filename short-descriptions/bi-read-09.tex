\textbf{Q9.}
Given two TagClasses (\texttt{tagClass1} and \texttt{tagClass2}), find
Forums that contain at least one Post with a Tag from \texttt{tagClass1}
and at least one Post with a Tag from \texttt{tagClass2} (direct
children not transitive) -- this may be the same Post.
Consider the Forums with a number of members greater than a given
threshold. For every such forum, count the number of Posts that have a
Tag from TagClass1 (\texttt{count1}), and the number of posts that have
a tag from TagClass2 (\texttt{count2}).
