\paragraph{Q14.}
For each \emph{Person}, count the number of \emph{Posts} they created in
the time interval \texttt{{[}begin,\ end{]}} (equivalent to the number
of threads they initiated) and the number of \emph{Messages} in each of
their (transitive) reply trees. When calculating \emph{Message} counts
only consider messages created within the given time interval.
Return each \emph{Person}, number of \emph{Posts} they created, and the
count of all \emph{Messages} that appeared in the reply trees (including
\emph{Post} at tree root) they created.
