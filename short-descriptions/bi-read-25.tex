\textbf{Q25.}
Given two Persons, find all (unweighted) shortest paths between these
two Persons, in the subgraph induced by the Knows relationship.
Then, for each path calculate a weight. The nodes in the path are
Persons, and the weight of a path is the sum of weights between every
pair of consecutive Person nodes in the path.
The weight for a pair of Persons is calculated such that every reply (by
one of the Persons) to a Post (by the other Person) contributes 1.0, and
every reply (by ones of the Persons) to a Comment (by the other Person)
contributes 0.5.
Only consider messages that were created in a forum that was created
within the timeframe \texttt{{[}startDate,\ endDate{]}}.
Return all the paths with shortest length, and their weights.
