\paragraph{\textbf{Q11}. Unrelated replies.}
Find those \emph{Persons} of a given \emph{Country} that replied to any
\emph{Message}, such that the reply does not have any \emph{Tag} in
common with the \emph{Message} (only direct replies are considered,
transitive ones are not). Consider only those replies that do no contain
any word from a given \texttt{blacklist}. For each \emph{Person} and
valid reply, retrieve the \emph{Tags} associated with the reply, and
retrieve the number of \emph{likes} on the reply.
The detailed conditions for checking blacklisted words is currently as
follows. Words do \emph{not} have to stand separately, i.e.~if the word
``Green'' is blacklisted, ``South-Greenland'' cannot be included in the
results. Also, comparison should be done in a case-sensitive way. These
conditions are preliminary and might be changed in later versions of the
benchmark.
