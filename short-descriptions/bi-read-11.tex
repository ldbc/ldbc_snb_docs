\paragraph{\textbf{Q11}. Unrelated replies.}
Find those \emph{Persons} of a given \emph{Country} that replied to any
\emph{Message}, such that the reply does not have any \emph{Tag} in
common with the \emph{Message} (only direct replies are considered,
transitive ones are not). Consider only those replies not containing any
word from a given \texttt{blacklist}. For each \emph{Person} and valid
reply, retrieve the \emph{Tags} associated with the reply, and retrieve
the number of \emph{likes} on the reply.
