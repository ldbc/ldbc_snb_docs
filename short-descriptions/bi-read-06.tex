\paragraph{Q6.}

Get Persons who have created a Message (Post or Comment) with a given
Tag.

Each Person has a score, computed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Count of Messages with the given Tag (\texttt{messageCount}).
\item
  Count of Likes (\texttt{likeCount}) and Comments (\texttt{replyCount})
  in reply of their Messages with the given Tag (direct relation not
  transitive).
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{score} is calculated as a sum with the following weights:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Messages (\texttt{messageCount}) are multiplied by 1,
\item
  Comments to Messages (\texttt{replyCount}) are multiplied by 2,
\item
  Likes (\texttt{likeCount}) are multiplied by 10.
\end{itemize}
